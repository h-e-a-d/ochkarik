## SEMANTIC STRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS

### Current Issues & Solutions

#### 1. Missing H2 for Testimonials
**Current:** Testimonial section has no H2 (only testimonial text)
**Should be:**
```html
<h2>What Our Patients Say</h2>
<!-- Plus subtitle describing real patient experiences -->
```

#### 2. Missing H2 for Vision Test
**Current:** Has subtitle but no semantic H2 header
**Should be:**
```html
<h2>Interactive Vision Test</h2>
<p>Test your vision at home using our interactive Snellen chart</p>
```

#### 3. Missing H2 for Partners
**Current:** Uses paragraph text instead of H2
**Should be:**
```html
<h2>Trusted Professional Network</h2>
```

#### 4. Stats Section Heading
**Current:** No semantic heading, just displayed number
**Should be:**
```html
<h2 class="sr-only">Professional Experience</h2>
<!-- Visual display remains the same -->
```

enough tears or produce poor quality tears, causing discomfort,
burning, itching, and potentially blurred vision. This can result
from age, environmental factors, medical conditions, or medications.

Treatment Options:
- Artificial tear drops
- Prescription eye medications
- Lifestyle modifications (screen breaks, humidifiers)
- Professional tear analysis and customized treatment plans
